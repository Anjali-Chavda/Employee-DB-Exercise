# MySQL Learning with the "Employees" Database

This repository contains the results of my self-learning journey using MySQL for data analytics and business intelligence. Through a series of practical exercises, I developed a solid understanding of SQL and its application in analyzing data and supporting business decisions.

## Objective
To master SQL skills using MySQL, focusing on data analysis and business intelligence.

## Learning Highlights

### Database Structure
- Worked with the "employees" database, which includes tables such as employees, departments, salaries, and titles. This realistic dataset provided a comprehensive foundation for practicing SQL queries and understanding relational database concepts.

### Core SQL Skills
- **Basic Queries:** Learned to write simple SELECT statements to retrieve data.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Applied WHERE clauses, logical operators, and ORDER BY clauses to filter and sort data.
- **Aggregate Functions:** Used COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX to perform calculations on data sets.
- **Grouping Data:** Utilized GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to group data and filter groups of rows.
- **Joins:** Mastered different types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) to combine data from multiple tables.

### Advanced SQL Techniques
- **Subqueries:** Created complex queries using nested subqueries.
- **Views:** Created and managed views to simplify complex queries and enhance security.
- **Stored Procedures and Functions:** Implemented stored procedures and functions to encapsulate business logic within the database.

### Practical Applications
- **Data Analysis:** Performed various forms of data analysis to derive insights from the "employees" database.
- **Business Intelligence:** Used SQL to support business decision-making processes by extracting and analyzing relevant data.
- **Reporting:** Generated reports tailored to specific business needs based on the data queried from the database.

## Learning Approach
- **Real-World Scenarios:** Engaged in exercises mimicking real-life scenarios for contextual learning.
- **Hands-On Practice:** Emphasized practical application to reinforce learning and ensure effective mastery of SQL concepts.
